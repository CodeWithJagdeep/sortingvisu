# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

This project provides a visual representation of several popular sorting algorithms. It showcases how algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort sort an array of random integers. The animations allow users to better understand the sorting process by showing comparisons, swaps, and the final sorted array.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize five common sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Animation**: Each algorithm's steps are animated, including:
  - Comparison of elements
  - Swapping of elements
  - Bar height transition and movement
- **Dynamic Algorithm Selection**: Choose the algorithm to run through a user interface.
- **Random Array Generation**: Generate random arrays to test different algorithms.
  
## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeWithJagdeep/sortingvisu.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sortingvisu
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the sorting visualization in action.

## Supported Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the sorted portion.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time, inserting each new element into the correct position.
- **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and merges them back together.
- **Quick Sort**: Divides the array into two partitions, sorts them independently, and combines them using a pivot.
